# Flutter3_Reflutter_APK
This script automates the process of fixing Flutter-based APKs that lack an x86 build of libflutter.so (common issue when running on Genymotion or x86 emulators).  The result is a fully patched, aligned, and signed APK that includes an x86-compatible, making it run smoothly on Genymotion and x86 Android emulators.
